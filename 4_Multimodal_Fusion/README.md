# Requirements

# Usage

## Step 1. Train the multimodal fusion model on all brainparts
- Train the multimodal fusion model on all brainparts.
- Perform SHAP analysis on the trained model.
- Perform feature importance analysis and feature selection on the trained model.
- Re-train the model with the selected features.
- Save the trained model to `./models/`.
